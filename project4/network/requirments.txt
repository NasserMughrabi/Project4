Single Page Application is an application that has only one page with mutiple divisions in it. However, these divisions do not appear all at the same time but in fact some show and some hide depending on the user's interaction with interface.

For this application we should have single HTML page with these divisions:

1. All posts division
2. new post textarea division
2. Profile division
3. following division (posts only by people that the user follow)
4. next button division
5. previous button division
6. edit post division
7. like button and label division
8. unlike button and label division

1. models.py - server side database
2. index.HTML - client side 
3. index.js - client side
4. style.css - client side
